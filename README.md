## Project Topic

The topic of our final project will be about [difacomputer](www.difacomputer.com) This web is an e-commerce web, that sells *IT Things.* Here's what it looks like :

###### What Parts of This Web That We Think is Bad

- No Buy or Add to Cart Button

  If we click the item for detailed information, there is no buy or add to cart button in that page. We need to go back to page that is showcasing all item.

  For this, we think that even in the item details, there should be a button to add the item to the cart. This way, the user won't have to go back to previous page to add it to the cart.

- No Price Tag

  In the showcase page or item details, there is no information of the item's price. We won't know how much the item's price is until we add it to the cart and then go to our cart page. The only place the price is showing is that page.

  You can look at image above, that there is no single information about the price of the item, but when you add it to the cart and go to the cart page it shows.

  For this, we think that it should show the item price tag because it is one of the most important information that buyer needs. It will be irritating to know the item's price only when we add the item to the cart.
